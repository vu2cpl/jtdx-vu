# HANDOVER — JTDX-VU

Last updated: 2026-09-28

## Current state

- **Repo:** `vu2cpl/jtdx-vu` (private), default branch `jtdx-vu`. The
  `upstream` remote is `jtdx-project/jtdx`; upstream has been dormant
  since 2022-03 at tag 159.
- **Installed app:** `/Applications/JTDX-VU.app` has the rename but
  **not yet Club Log/alerts**: it was running, so it wasn't replaced. The
  current build is `build/bundle/JTDX-VU.app`. Quit JTDX-VU, then
  `ditto build/bundle/JTDX-VU.app /Applications/JTDX-VU.app`.
  Settings are in `~/Library/Preferences/JTDX-VU.ini` and data in
  `~/Library/Application Support/JTDX-VU`.
- **Stock JTDX:** `/Applications/jtdx.app`, with its `JTDX.ini` and
  `Application Support/JTDX`, is still installed and must be left
  alone. JTDX-VU only read it once, for the first-launch migration.
- **Shared-memory sysctl:** installed via
  `/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.jtdx.sysctl.plist` (shmmax 14680064). It
  may need redoing after a macOS upgrade.
- **Build and bundle:** see `README.md`. `./macos-bundle.sh` runs the
  CMake install step, then macdeployqt and the fix-ups, and signs the
  result: `build/bundle/JTDX-VU.app`.

## What changed

### 2026-09-28 — native build, JTDX-VU identity, Club Log and alerts

- **Build fixes for current toolchains.**
  - `lib/jplsubs.f`: `EXTERNAL SPLIT`. gfortran 16 added an F2023
    `SPLIT` intrinsic.
  - CMake 4 needs `-DCMAKE_POLICY_VERSION_MINIMUM=3.5`.
  - Docs and manpages are off, because asciidoctor and a2x aren't
    installed.
- **App name `JTDX-VU`** (`main.cpp`).
  - Titles, dialogs (`JTDXMessageBox.cpp`, `Configuration.cpp`) and
    the PSK Reporter ID all follow `applicationName()`.
  - Multi-instance detection used `applicationName().length()>4`; it is
    now `>7`.
- **First-launch migration** (`main.cpp`,
  `migrate_legacy_jtdx_state`).
  - Runs only if no `JTDX-VU[ - rig].ini` exists yet. It copies
    `JTDX[ - rig].ini` and the stock data dir, and rewrites data-dir
    paths inside the .ini.
- **Resource path bug** (`Configuration.cpp`, `installed_path`).
  - The data and doc paths were `<exe>/../../../jtdx.app/...`. They
    only worked because APFS is case-insensitive. After the bundle was
    renamed, the decoder read the *stock* `/Applications/jtdx.app`'s
    data. Paths now resolve through the bundle the app is running from.
- **`macos-bundle.sh`** does what macdeployqt misses:
  - copies `libgcc_s.1.1` (needed by libgfortran) and `libsharpyuv.0`
    (needed by libwebp*) into the bundle;
  - replaces the `rigctl*-jtdx` symlinks into the Homebrew Cellar with
    real files;
  - checks that no `/opt/homebrew` dependency remains.
- **Club Log worked-before source** (`clublog.{h,cpp}`,
  `logbook/adif.*`, `logbook/logbook.*`, `MainWindow::init_logbook`).
  - Fetch: `POST https://clublog.org/getadif.php` (email, app password,
    call). The response is rewritten one record per line to
    `Application Support/JTDX-VU/clublog_log.adi`.
  - When enabled, `ADIF::load` reads that file instead of
    `wsjtx_log.adi`, with no STATION_CALLSIGN or grid filter, since
    Club Log's log is already one callsign. Local QSOs from 7 days
    before the last fetch onward are added on top.
  - "Confirmed only" skips Club Log QSOs without `Y`/`V` in QSL_RCVD,
    LOTW_QSL_RCVD or EQSL_QSL_RCVD.
  - The fetch runs 3 s after start-up if the cache is more than 24 h
    old, or on "Refresh now".
- **Alerts** (`ClubLog::check_decode`, hooked in
  `MainWindow::readFromStdout` after `deCallAndGrid`).
  - ATNO, new band and new band+mode, checked through JTDX's own
    `LogBook::matchDXCC`. The own call is skipped.
  - Cooldown is keyed on call, band and mode.
  - Transports: macOS notification via `osascript`, and Telegram
    `sendMessage`.
  - Secrets are in the Keychain (service `JTDX-VU`, accounts
    `clublog-app-password` and `telegram-bot-token`) and written
    through `security -i` on stdin.
- The settings UI is a code-built dialog, File > Club Log & Alerts...,
  so `Configuration.ui` is untouched and upstream merges stay easy. The
  values are in `[ClubLog]` and `[Alerts]` in JTDX-VU.ini.
- **Dropped:** MSHV's AS (All Slots). JTDX has no Multi-Answer mode,
  so there's no slot restriction for it to lift.

### Verified

- The build runs from `/Applications` with zero `/opt/homebrew` loads.
- The migration copied 112 MB with correct .ini paths. Titles read
  JTDX-VU.
- The decoder's `-r` path is JTDX-VU's own bundle.
- **Loader test** with a synthetic 50k-QSO Club Log file in a
  `--rig-name test` instance (since deleted):
  - the FT8 count matched the file exactly (12,447);
  - confirmed-only matched exactly (3,761);
  - it adds about 0.5 s to start-up.
- The dialog renders, and a macOS notification arrives.

## Open items

- [ ] **Not yet tested against real Club Log.** Enter the email and app
      password in File > Club Log & Alerts..., press Refresh now, and
      check the status line QSO count against Club Log.
- [ ] **Telegram is untested.** Enter the bot token and chat ID, then
      press Send test.
- [ ] A **real decode alert** hasn't fired yet. Watch for one on air.
- [ ] **CAT control** with Hamlib 4.7.2 (stock, not the JTDX Hamlib
      fork) is not yet verified on the rig.
- [ ] Rows already on screen keep their colour after a Club Log
      refresh, since JTDX colours rows when they're inserted.
- [ ] macOS notifications show the Script Editor icon, because they go
      through osascript.

## Known gotchas

- **Don't use `install/` as the CMake prefix.** On a case-insensitive
  volume it collides with the `INSTALL` file; use `build/dist`, which
  the script handles.
- **CMake's own `fixup_bundle`** in the install step fails on
  `@rpath/libsharpyuv`. That's expected, and the script tolerates it.
- **A `brew upgrade`** of qt@5, hamlib, gcc or webp only affects the
  next bundle, not the installed app. Rebuild and re-bundle after one.
